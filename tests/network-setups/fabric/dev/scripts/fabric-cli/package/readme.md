## Setup Artifactory token for fabric-interop-sdk

1) Go to IBM artifactory (https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/)
2) Click on your email id on top right
3) Generate/Copy the API key from profile, let's say it is - "ThisIsMyAPIKey"
4) Run this command on your system - 
	 curl --header 'X-JFrog-Art-Api: ThisIsMyAPIKey' https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/npm/auth
5) The above command will return you auth token along with auth settings and your email id from artifactory.
6) Create a .npmrc file in the backend folder (from where you want to run npm install)
7) Add this line to your .npmrc file,
	 @res-dlt-interop:registry=https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/npm/res-dlt-interop-npm-local/
8) Add the output of curl to that file.
9) Final .npmrc should look like this - 
   "@res-dlt-interop:registry=https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/npm/res-dlt-interop-npm-local/
    _auth = <Auth-token>
    always-auth = true
    email = user@email.com"
10) Run npm install to check if artifactory connection is working before testing/deployment.
