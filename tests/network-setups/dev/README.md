# Local Development Setup

This folder contains the setup of the networks that are run and deployed in the local environment.
The directory is organised with a folder for the configuration settings for each type of network.

- `fabric` contains the configuration settings for fabric networks
- `corda` contains the configuration settings for corda networks

The local development is based on networks operated and managed with Docker Compose.
