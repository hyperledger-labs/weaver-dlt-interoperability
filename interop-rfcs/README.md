# Interoperability RFCs

The RFCs capture abstractions, models, protocols and data formats for facilitating cross-ledger communication. For newcomers we recommend starting with the protocol [overview]() document followed by the RFCs on _models_. Protocol engineers will find [RFC: 01-006](/models/relays.md) on the relay model a useful read and may progress on to reading one of the existing protocol design and implementations. If you are interested in adding support for a new ledger technology, see implementing a [new driver]() and implementing [interoperability modules]() for your ledger technology. Where relevant we use [ABNF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) for formal syntax definitions.

Through out the RFCs if you come across terminology that might be not well defined in the context it is used in, refer to [terminology](terminology.md) for precise definitions of these terms.
