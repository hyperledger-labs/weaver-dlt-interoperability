# Data Transfer Protocol

-   Authors: Antony Targett, Nick Waywood
-   Status: Proposed
-   Tags: feature, protocol

## Summary

A protocol (request-response protocol) to request and receive data between two
network relays. This specification details how one relay can formulate a request for
data from another network's relay.

## Motivation

Data transfer (i.e. querying data) across ledgers is one of the fundamental features of interoperability.

## Name and Version

Data Transfer v0.1
data_transfer_v0.1

## Key Concepts

-   [Discovery protocol](/protocols/discovery-protocol/readme.md) - Before a data transfer can occur between two networks, the requesting network needs to be aware of other networks. The discovery protocol is responsible for this.
-   [Addressing](/formats/addressing.md) - Addressing is how a network can
    specify the data it wants from another network. The [view](/models/views.md)
    is also closely related to this concept.
-   Proofs - When data is sent from one network to another, the network that is sending the data also needs to send an associated proof with the data. [Proof representation](/models/cryptographic-proofs.md) is responsible for this.

## Roles

There are two roles in the `data-transfer` protocol: `requester` and `responder`. The requester asks the responder for some data, and the responder answers. Each role uses a single message type.

## States

This is a classic two-step request~response interaction, so it uses the predefined state machines for any `requester` and `responder`:

\*\* Should this state diagram include validation of messages?

## Messages

### `query` message type

A `data-transfer/query` message constructed by the requesting relay looks like this:

```protobuf
message Query {
  repeated string policy = 1;
  string address = 2;
  string requesting_relay = 3;
  string requesting_network = 4;
  string certificate = 5;
  string requestor_signature = 6;
  string nonce = 7;
  string request_id = 8;
  string requesting_org = 9;
}
```

-   `policy` The policy array outlines which orgs need to sign the payload.
-   `address` uniquely identifies the resource that the requesting network is
    querying. See [address concept](/formats/addressing.md) for more details.
-   `requesting_relay` is the identity of the requesting relay
-   `requesting_network` is the identity of the requesting network
-   `certificate` is a valid identity certificate of the requesting entity. This
    is used by the responding network to authenticate the requestor.
-   `requestor_signature` is the signature of the requestor used by the responding
    network to verify that the request came from a party they trust. The signature
    is signed on the view address segment of the `address` field (refer to
    [addressing](/formats/addressing.md)) concatenated with the `nonce` field. The
    signature is provided as a Base64-encoded string.
-   `nonce` is a unique number that is created on a per-request basis. It ensures
    that if a request is intercepted by a malicious party, the request cannot be
    reused in a replay attack.
-   `request_id` is the identifier given to the request to enable the requesting
    network and relays to track the request.
-   `requesting_org` is the org from the requesting network that initiated the request.

### Response message type

A `data-transfer/ViewPayload` messaged is returned to the requester and looks like this:

```protobuf
message ViewPayload {
  string request_id = 1;
  oneof state {
    View view = 2;
    string error = 3;
  };
}

message View {
  Meta meta = 1;
  bytes data = 2;
}

message Meta {
    enum Protocol {
        BITCOIN = 0;
        ETHEREUM = 1;
        FABRIC = 3;
        CORDA = 4;
    }
    Protocol protocol = 1;
    string timestamp = 2;
    string proof_type = 3;
    string serialization_format = 4;
}
```

`ViewPayload`

-   `request_id` the identifier of the original request.
-   `state` either contains a `view` if the request was succesful, or else
    `error`.
-   `view` contains the metadata and data associated with the requested view.
-   `error` contains a message about the cause of the error

`View`

-   `meta` contains metadata of the view.
-   `data` contains the requested data, including ledger data and the proof.

`Meta`

-   `protocol` specifies the network protocol of the responder network.
-   `timestamp` the timestamp of the response.
-   `proof_type` describes the type of proof, e.g. Notarization, SPV, ZKP, etc.
    Possibly will be an enum. See [proof
    representation](/models/cryptographic-proofs.md) for more details.
-   `serialization_format` the data field's serialization format (e.g. JSON, XML, Protobuf).
