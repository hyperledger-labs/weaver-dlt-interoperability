The Weaver specifications (RFCs) capture abstractions, models, protocols and data formats for enabling cross-ledger communication. 

For newcomers we recommend starting with the protocol overview document followed by the RFCs on models. Protocol engineers will find RFC: 01-006 on the relay model a useful read and may progress on to reading one of the existing protocol design and implementations. If you are interested in adding support for a new ledger technology, see implementing a new driver and implementing interoperability modules for your ledger technology. Where relevant we use ABNF for formal syntax definitions.
