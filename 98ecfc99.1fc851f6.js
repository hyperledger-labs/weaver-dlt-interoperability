(You will need one service per channel.) Though such sharing can be implemented using several different mechanisms, ranging from manual to automated, the simplest and most modular way is to expose a REST endpoint that agents in foreign networks can reach. Further, this REST endpoint can be implemented as a standalone web application or it can be an extension of one or more of the existing Layer-2 applications. (Multiple apps can expose the same endpoint serving the same information for redundancy.) We will demonstrate an example of this while leaving other implementation modes to the user.\nLet's say a Fabric network consists of two organizations called ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"myorg1")," and ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"myorg2"),", each running a Layer-2 application with a web server whose URL prefixes are ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"http://myorg1.mynetwork.com:9000")," and ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"http://myorg2.mynetwork.com:9000")," respectively.
